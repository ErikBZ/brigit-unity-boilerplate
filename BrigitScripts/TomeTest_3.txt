Diana{ I didn't want to be the one to forget* }
Diego{ I thought of everything I'd never regret* }

@player{
    A little time with you is all that I get*->Chorus
    That's all we need because that's all we can take*->{
        Diego{ One thing I never see the same when you're round* }
    }
    I don't believe in him - his lips on the ground*
    I wanna take you back to the place by the rock*
}

Diana{ But no one gives us time anymore* }

Diego{ Will you be my light?* }

>Chorus{
    Diego{
        I gotta be in  your arms baby*
        But far away I seek for your light*
        I hold on because for you my heart keeps beating*
